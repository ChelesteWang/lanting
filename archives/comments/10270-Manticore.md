The $15 million round was led by Epic Games, the first outside investment that the Fortnite maker has made, a significant seal of approval for Manticore’s technology, which is called Core. San Manteo, California-based Manticore had already taken in $45 million since launching in February 2017.

Manticore follows on the success of a broad trend toward user-created games that has already led to billion-dollar valuations for Minecraft and Roblox. Both of those companies target younger audiences than Manticore.

Descamps and cofounder Jordan Maynard come from that old world they’re determined to disrupt. Descamps studied the video games business while getting his Standford MBA in the 2000s; he graduated and founded a gaming studio with Maynard, who’d been a computer science major at San Diego State. They sold the company, A Bit Lucky, to Zynga ZNGA +2.1% and worked there for several years prior to leaving and starting Manticore in 2016.

They spent three years developing Core then made it available to creators in June 2019. It won an important partnership with Hasbro’s HAS +3.3% Dungeons and Dragons, and the two put together a contest this summer challenging players to create games using Core that were based on the venerable brand. The most popular was Forgotten Cisterns, a knight’s journey through a sewer full of undead enemies.
