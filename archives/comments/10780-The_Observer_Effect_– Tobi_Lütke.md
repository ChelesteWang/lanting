`Shopify is a 140B company. Tobi is a StarCraft player and donated prize pool money for it. 虫族玩家`

`Amazon is trying to build an empire and Shopify is trying to arm the rebels`

My attention is the most liquid and valuable resource that I have.

A day in my life really depends on what's happening. That said, usually I have themes. For instance, I have a priority list, and I have decision logs that chronicle all the things I am trying to figure out.

These cover different questions. For example, if I had just taken the company over, how would I change it? How would I build a company to potentially disrupt Shopify? I try to make my calendar match these bigger topics and other urgent priorities. In a way, the calendar is nothing more than a strategy. Although it's incredibly easy—and it has happened to me quite a lot—to have circumstances dictate the calendar. Because of this, there’s this constant tug of war between the actual priorities of the company and the kind of things that have to be done.

`Ditto`

I have a complex set of thoughts on this. It is really my core value. I believe that the job we all have in life is to acquire knowledge and wisdom and then share it. I just don’t know what else there is. This is the bedrock of my belief system.

When I get close to any field, I think about how far I want to go. I'm probably further along with programming. I don’t know if I want to get from 90 to 91% in programming when, with the same amount of work, I could figure out the first 60 to 70% of UX or even something like drawing. There’s a recent book about this called Range, which I really like. The book pushes in this direction and explores this topic a bit more than I do. But I just found myself nodding throughout reading it, because it turns out that very often—really, every field has fundamental wisdom that you discover when you're learning and talking to the people who have mastered it. I find that going wide and learning the best lessons from the people who have dedicated their entire lives to a certain pursuit gets you really, really close to mastery.

`可能我还是参谋长. 最好不过`

I really, really want as many people as possible to have the ability to engage in entrepreneurship, because there's a certain group of people who cannot work for other people, and they should have options, even in the digital world. And frankly, the internet has significantly pushed everything towards centralization and we know who owns most of it.

We ended up labeling my product-related things red, investor/Board of Director-related things some kind of teal color, et cetera. And the thing I’m looking for is a balanced week; a week where, ideally, I manage to devote about 30% of the time—at least—to the product and then as much as possible to things like recruiting, bigger picture projects, and one-on-ones.

..when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably incorrect...

I find that the first 80% of every field is pretty quick to learn—it’s equivalent to the Pareto principle—and I think that creativity generally is people using lessons from one field in another field in different ways. Because of this, I find learning fascinating.

You wrote a script to delete every recurring meeting at Shopify. Talk about why you did that, and what you ended up learning from it.

you know what, I should talk about books. One thing that is interesting is how people have accused Shopify of being a book club thinly veiled as a public company.

We tend to read a lot and talk about a lot of books. We read Nassim Taleb’s books and one person on my team began talking about Antifragile and gave an outline. He said, “I think Nassim is putting a word to the thing that you keep talking about…”

`过分了兄弟`

Before this, I would just log in and shut down various servers to teach the team what’s now called chaos engineering.

Effectively, we looked for the business equivalent of just turning off servers to see if the system has resiliency. For instance, we used to ask people to use their mouse on their non-dominant hand for a day. We introduced these little nudges to ensure that people didn’t become complacent.

our unique problem: namely, Shopify was a company initially for American customers, built by German founders, in Canada.

`Oh you know well`

For instance, if we had built the company in Israel, this would not have been a challenge.

`I wouldn't dare`

That was a tangent, but to get back to the question you asked, we found that standing meetings were a real issue. They were extremely easy to create, and no one wanted to cancel them because someone was responsible for its creation. The person requesting to cancel would rather stick it out than have a very tough conversation saying, “Hey, this thing that you started is no longer valuable.” It’s just really difficult. So, we ran some analysis and we found out that half of all standing meetings were viewed as not valuable. It was an enormous amount of time being wasted. So we asked, “Why don't we just delete all meetings?” And so we did. It was pretty rough, but we now operate on a schedule.

It was such a profound moment. Even to just communicate with people in other places. It made this enormous impression on me as this force of democratization. I found that the internet’s presence gave something to people that they just couldn't imagine. I was thinking about this the other day: as a twelve-year-old, the only way I could partake in end-to-end communication was maybe ham radio. That was it! That was all. And then the internet comes around and you are able to see anyone and just talk.

Later, I had a little bit of a crisis with my craft. I had done tons of fun programming, especially open source and demos, these kinds of things. Then I was briefly paid by Siemens to write code in a sort of constricted way. It resembled the opposite of jazz: when everyone had a song sheet and you had to reproduce a dead person's music poorly. But that was how you get rewarded and promoted. And so again, the misaligned incentive system reinforced this kind of thing.

But the major reason why video games are valuable is because of this concept of transfer learning. For instance, people who are good at chess understand when it's time to perform tactics, and when it's time to focus on positional development. Not just in chess, but also in life.

A coach is probably one of the highest returns on investment anyone can do with their attention. An hour spent with a coach has a 10x, 50x, 100x potential return on time spent.
