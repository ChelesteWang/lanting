If you do it wrong, then there is often also the “meeting after the meeting”, wherein some of the stakeholders who nodded and smiled during your meeting go off afterwards and agree to do something different, and you might find out a month later if you’re lucky. This can happen when you fail to do the meeting before the meeting properly, and you don’t have a trust relationship with them. These two things go hand in hand — if you have a trust relationship, the meeting before the meeting is usually five minutes.

If you don’t have a trust relationship with a stakeholder, then your best bet is to never ever bring them a solution. Don’t ever bring solutions to problems, since they tend to alarm people. Just bring your problems! If you share your problem with someone, it can help them see things your way, and then you can begin negotiating your way toward a solution that works for you both.

The art of leadership at Grab is really the art of achieving alignment. And it’s hard, because of the way the company is organized around inviolate business units with absolute veto power: Cross-functional initiatives are exceptionally difficult to roll out, even when they are clearly in the best interests of the company. But Grabbers are as tenacious as they are gentle, and they always eventually push through. Politely.

I hope my culture observations haven’t come across as negative, because it’s not at all — it’s only negative if you don’t understand and you’re trying to swim upstream. The culture is just how people do things there. If you understand and embrace it, you can thrive and be very effective (as long as you can also stay up until 3am every day).
