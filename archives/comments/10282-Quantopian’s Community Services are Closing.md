Our mission was to break open quant finance and make it accessible to everyone. You helped realize this mission and came together to form the biggest community of quants the world has ever seen. For that, I am extremely proud and grateful. I sincerely hope that Quantopian is just one milestone in your journey through quantitative finance. Knowing so many of you and your creative energy, I expect you will use your Quantopian experience to learn and grow, and look for new ways to disrupt the industry.
