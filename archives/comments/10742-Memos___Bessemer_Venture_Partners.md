`Aha, 他们在做一样的事情. BVP说: 从错误中学习是容易的, 我们Venture Capitalist天天都在做了. 如何从成功中学?`

| Airbnb | Jeremy Levine met Brian Chesky in January 2010, the first $100K revenue month. Brian’s $40M valuation ask was “crazy," but Jeremy was impressed and made a plan to reconnect in May. Unbeknownst to Jeremy, $100K in January became 200 in February and 300 in March. In April, Airbnb raised money at 1.5X the “crazy” price. Their last fundraising was completed at ~500X that valuation. | 月营收100K的时候估值40M, 也就是40x市销率. 300K的时候就已经只剩10多倍了. 实际那一轮close在60M. 现在是100B USD, 100x |
| Apple | Bessemer had the opportunity to invest in pre-IPO secondary stock in Apple at a $60M valuation. Neill Brownstein called it "outrageously expensive." | 我们其实都不明白数字, 我们都不明白钱. 我们永远觉得贵. 没错, 在上一个时代贵. 时代变了, 加速地变着 |
| Atlassian | Byron Deeter flew straight to Atlassian in 2006 when he caught wind of a developer tool from Australia (of all places!). Notes from the meeting included “totally self-financed, started with a credit card” and “great business, but Scott & Mike don’t ever want to be a public company.” Years and countless meetings later, the first opportunity to invest emerged in 2010, but the $400m company valuation was thought to be a tad “rich." In 2015, Atlassian became the largest tech IPO in Australian history, and the shares we passed on are worth more than a billion dollars today. | 06年的时候永远不想上市, 15年终于上市. 唯一不变的是变化, 还是阿里鸡贼, 也开脱了阿里游戏 |
| Ebay | "Stamps? Coins? Comic books? You've GOT to be kidding," thought David Cowan. "No-brainer pass." | "什么? 二次元啥玩意? ACG? 谁看视屏想要会飞的字幕? 我到现在都关掉". VC也是一个自找苦吃的工种. 我们每个人都会被时代抛下, 但是VC要亲身体验, 被时代抛下的同时还被case抛下, 心灵打击还破财 |
| Facebook | Jeremy Levine spent a weekend at a corporate retreat in the summer of 2004 dodging persistent Harvard undergrad Eduardo Saverin's rabid pitch. Finally, cornered in a lunch line, Jeremy delivered some sage advice, "Kid, haven't you heard of Friendster? Move on. It's over!" | 所以呢? 我们觉得是STP里面的S? 一个没成不能证伪, 一个成了可以证实吗? 美团外卖是一个双边市场, 它有power吗? 或许是process power? 现实世界是一个混沌系统, 比下定性判断的商业理论更复杂 |
| FedEx | Incredibly, Bessemer passed on Federal Express seven times. | Pass on BTC十次的人应该成山成海 |
| Google | David Cowan’s college friend rented her garage to Sergey and Larry for their first year. In 1999 and 2000 she tried to introduce Cowan to “these two really smart Stanford students writing a search engine.” Students? A new search engine? In the most important moment ever for Bessemer’s anti-portfolio, Cowan asked her, “How can I get out of this house without going anywhere near your garage?”| |
| Intel | Pete Bancroft never quite settled on terms with Bob Noyce, who instead took venture financing from a guy named Arthur Rock. | 我们总是去聊细则, 去讨价还价, 丢西瓜捡芝麻. A公司给你好吃的食堂, 独立健身房, 报销打车, Herman-Miller外加4K显示器, 你就忘了, B公司会100x |
| PayPal | David Cowan passed on the Series A round. Rookie team, regulatory nightmare, and, 4 years later, a $1.5 billion acquisition by eBay. | VC们多少也明白了, 不能苛责. 永远都是against all odds. 所以庄明浩说, "看命" |
| Snapchat | In 2011 Jeremy Levine arrived at LAX three hours late, thanks to flight delays, with enough time for only one of the two meetings on his calendar. He literally tossed a quarter and phoned Evan Spiegel with his regrets. SNAP was the largest IPO in 2017. | 还是小事. 一张机票, 或是一点麻烦 |
| Tesla | In 2006 Byron Deeter met the team and test-drove a roadster. He put a deposit on the car, but passed on the negative margin company telling his partners, "It's a win-win. I get a great car and some other VC pays for it!" The company passed $30B in market cap in 2014. Byron paid full price for his Model X. | 太难了. 认知不到就是不到 |
| Zoom | After trying several next-gen video conferencing products, it was clear to Alex Ferrara that Zoom was a winner. Most importantly, he was impressed by its engineer-turned-founder, Eric Yuan. But video conferencing was crowded with entrenched incumbents and multiple startups in the market, so Alex passed on Zoom’s series B in 2014. Better late than never, we invested in Zoom’s IPO at a $9 billion valuation. | |
