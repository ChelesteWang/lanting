- Keep innovating the product
  - It's not money / headcount; it's who's doing it
  - How many qualified Pickers & Builders do you have? Build your org around that

- Win the market
  - Early adopters illusion
- Hone distribution power
  - Distribution channel is as important. Put in the growth effort
- Org & business: finance+M&A, HR+recruiting, legal, marketing, PR, investor relations
  - Utilize M&A. Think Google.
- Moat
  - is the ability to charge more, not defend by charging less. Charging more equals faster growth
